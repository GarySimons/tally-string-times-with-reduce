## Adding Up Times with Reduce

This was a lesson where we needed to find out the total running time of a list of videos.

Firstly using 'split', the list was split into hours and minutes. 

With 'map(parseFloat)', the strings were converted to numbers so they could be added together.

using 'reduce' the numbers were added togeher to create a total in seconds.

using 'Math.floor' to get whole numbers and '%' to get the number left. We were able to work out the total in hours, minutes and seconds.
